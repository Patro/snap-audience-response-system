Snap is an Audience Response System that allows its users to host live polls
based on single and multiple choice questions.

To get started you create a new interactive session. Afterwards you receive an
invitation code that you can hand over to your audience to join it. As soon as
everyone joined you can start live polls based on your questions and present
the results on a second screen afterwards.
